[Here is the Story of our Experience][github] After a month of Summer Practice at Haufe.Groupe , I am going to write about my experience there.So if you are interested, it will take just a few minutes to read about it.

First of all we were two students at Haufe ,we have been selected from 20 students after an interview. However, our task was create an application of Feedback Box using Meteor Framework.

Here is a short description about the task:
- The employees of Haufe are the users of the application and each of them will have an account.

- Each user can add feedbacks and the othes can vote it or reply to it.

- The tasks will apear according to votes number.

- Delete - is called when the App is deleted from the campaign   


At the beginning, Meteor was a good choice it helps me alot during the development prosses, Meteor needs to know just javascript language which is very simple for a small projects like our task.
The pinciple disadvantage is that Meteor is very new and there is not so much tutorials.
